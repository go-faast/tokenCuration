# United States

The United States proves to be one of the most complex regulatory environments with respect to tokens and digital assets. Comments and policies by regulators tend to change rapidly and without warning.

Based on this, a prudent approach is to assess if a token readily available on the market, being offered from firms which are well managed, regulated and have clear policies on token availability. In adhering to this approach, there will be no meaningful additional access to the US market of these tokens or assets.

# Comments by Regulatory Agencies

## Secutities and Exchange Comission

 1. [ Statement on Digital Assets and Trading ](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/digital-asset-securites-issuuance-and-trading)
- Based on this assessment, additional care is to be taken being taken with respect to utility tokens, as they may be classified as securities

2. [Remarks by William Hinman](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418)

> putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions

 - Based on these statements, a token that has completed a fundraise is not necessarily a security; ethereum completed a fundraise, but is not at this time a security.

## Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006

In 2006 the United States congress passed what is now known as [UIGEA](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2010/fil10035a.pdf), which imposes severe restrictions on online gaming and gambling. Tokens that are designed specifically to assist in or facilitate online gambling may be considered to be:

> (i) automated clearing house (ACH) systems, (ii) card systems, (iii) check collection systems, (iv) money transmitting businesses, and (v) wire transfer systems.
